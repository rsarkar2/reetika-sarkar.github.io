# About Me

I’m originally from Delhi, India, and moved to North Carolina to pursue my Ph.D. in Statistics at UNC Greensboro. My work bridges theory and real-world impact — particularly in healthcare. I’ve had the privilege of interning at Novartis (Oncology Pharmacometrics) and JMP Life Sciences (SAS), where I deepened my passion for pharmaceutical research.

My research and professional journey has been guided by the goal of solving meaningful problems that improve human lives. I’ve worked on feature selection for genomic data, and more recently, on statistical methods for safety signal detection.

Outside of academics, I enjoy time in nature, reading on neurodivergence and mental well-being, and spending time with my family.
