# Research

My research focuses on statistical methodology and applied problems in the biomedical sciences. My dissertation work revolves around two primary areas:

## ðŸ“Œ Feature Selection in High-Dimensional Genomic Data

- Developed the **rPGBS** method for robust variable selection in the presence of correlated covariates and gene group structures.
- Conducted comparative studies of regularization-based techniques (LASSO, Elastic Net, SCAD, etc.).
- Published an R package implementing the rPGBS algorithm.

## ðŸ“Œ Safety Signal Detection in Post-Marketing Surveillance

- Investigated improved Apriori and bootstrap-based methods for detecting drug-AE associations.
- Proposed percentile bootstrap confidence intervals for disproportionality measures (PRR, RR, ROR).
- Conducted simulation studies under AE correlation and rarity to assess reliability and threshold optimization.

Broadly, I am interested in:

- Causal inference
- Statistical software testing and validation
- Applications in oncology, pharmacovigilance, and real-world evidence
